# Spotify SDK Test (Android)
First time using Spotify's SDK to connect an Android app to Spotify & play music!

Currently uses Spotify's App Remote SDK to open the Spotify app on the user's Android phone, and start playing a playlist of indie songs (hardcoded for now).

Also shows the name of the currently playing song & artist in the app itself. Not much, just me messing around with stuff.
